 * john and mike both play basketball in diffrent teams. in the latest 3 games,
 *  john's team scored 89 , 120 and 103 points, while mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points.
 * 1. calculate the average score for each team.
 * 2. decide which teams wins in average( highest average score), and print the winner
 * to the console. also include the average score in the output.
 * 3. then change the scores to show diffrent winners . don't forget to take into
 *  account there might be a draw (the same average score)
 *
 * 4. EXTRA : Mary also plays basketball , and her team scored 97 , 134 and 105 points .
 *  like before , log the average winner to the console. Hint: you will need the && operator to
 *   take the decision .
 *
 * 5 . change the scores to generate diffrent winners , keeping in mind there might be draws.

 * john and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 diffrent restaurants. the bill s were $124 ,
 *  $48 and $268 .
 * to tip the waiter a fair amount , john created a simple tip calculator (as a function).
 *  He likes to tip %20 of the bill when the bill is less than $50 , 15% when the bill is between
 *   $50 and $200 , and 10% if the bill is more than $200.
 * In the end. John would like to have 2 arrays :
 * 1) containing all three tips (one for each bill)
 * 2) containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip)
 *  Good Luck
